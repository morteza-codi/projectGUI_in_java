# Setting Up Your Project on GitHub

Follow these steps to upload your UML Generator project to GitHub:

## 1. Create a GitHub Account

If you don't already have one, create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## 2. Create a New Repository

1. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner of GitHub and select "New repository"
2. Name your repository (e.g., "UML-Generator")
3. Add a description (optional)
4. Choose public or private visibility
5. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (we've already created these files)
6. Click "Create repository"

## 3. Initialize Git in Your Local Project

Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## 4. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating your GitHub repository, you'll see instructions for pushing an existing repository. Run these commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/UML-Generator.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and `UML-Generator` with your repository name.

## 5. Verify Your Repository

1. Go to your GitHub profile
2. Find your new repository
3. Verify that all files have been uploaded correctly

## 6. Additional GitHub Features to Consider

- **GitHub Pages**: Create a project website
- **GitHub Actions**: Set up CI/CD workflows
- **GitHub Issues**: Track bugs and feature requests
- **GitHub Projects**: Manage your project with kanban boards

## 7. Sharing Your Repository

Share your repository URL with others to collaborate on your UML Generator project.

## 8. Keeping Your Repository Updated

After making changes to your local code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

Congratulations! Your UML Generator project is now on GitHub.
